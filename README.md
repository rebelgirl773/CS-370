In this project, I worked with code that implemented a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve a maze navigation problem. The provided code included basic structures for state management and initial environment setup. My contributions involved experimenting with parameters, such as the decay rate and epsilon value, to optimize the agent’s learning process. I also modified reward functions to fine-tune the agent's behavior, ensuring it could explore effectively while learning to avoid obstacles.

Computer science is a field focused on solving real-world problems by leveraging algorithms, data structures, and computation. Computer scientists design, develop, and maintain software and systems that drive innovations across industries—from healthcare to finance and beyond. Their work is vital because it creates tools and technologies that enhance efficiency, improve lives, and solve complex challenges.

As a computer science student, I’ve learned to approach problems systematically. The first step is to clearly define the problem and break it down into smaller components. From there, I identify applicable algorithms and technologies, implement solutions incrementally, and test frequently to catch issues early. Debugging and refining code is also essential, as it ensures the final product performs reliably under different conditions.

It is crucial to consider the impact of technology on both the end user and the organization. Transparency around data collection and privacy is essential to building user trust. For organizations, I aim to design solutions that align with ethical principles, fostering trust and maintaining integrity.
